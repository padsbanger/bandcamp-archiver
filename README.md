# bandcamp-archiver
Cli tool to archive Bandcamp albums


## Installation

```bash

cargo run -- --url album_url

```

## TODO

- Create scapper struct
- Create album struct
- Create song struct
- Download whole album into a directory


Nice to have:
- Download using threads
- Get metadata from file if not present in scapped response
- Download whole artist discography
- Implement some kind of CLI UI Interface with progress bars
